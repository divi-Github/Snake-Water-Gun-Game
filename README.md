# Snake-Water-Gun-Game
Snake Water Gun (SWG) is a simple Python-based game where you compete against the computer. Each player (you and the computer) chooses one of three options: snake, water, or gun. The winner is determined based on the rules: Snake beats water (snake drinks water) | Water beats gun (water rusts the gun) | Gun beats snake (gun shoots the snake)
